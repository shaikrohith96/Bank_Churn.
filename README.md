# COST-SENSITIVE FOR BANK CHRUN PREDICATION

The case study is about a bank manager worried about the increasing number of churns in the credit card service. In a business, the cost to get a new customer is usually much higher than what it takes to keep an existing one. For this purpose, the main goal will be predicting the highest number of potential churners to let the manager proactively propose better offers to customers.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle.com

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This step involves data preprocessing, summary statistics, data visualization, and feature engineering.

# Predictive Analysis
The predictive analysis employs a decision tree model to predict potential churners. The decision tree is chosen as it is interpretable and can handle imbalanced datasets, which are common in churn prediction problems. The focus here is to maximize the recall of potential churners while considering the cost-sensitive nature of the problem.
